  <h1>Make Applying to LACity Work <b>Easier</b></h1> <!-- The phrase "It takes a year, but itâ€™s worth a lifetime!" is a little daunting, and already assumes prior knowledge. Thought this might be snappier -->
  <p><a href="./#team">We</a> want you to work for the City of Los Angeles. But the process can seem confusing. Understanding the process can help make it easier to persue a public service career.</p>

  <p>There are 3 different types of City Job:</p>
  <ul><li>Exempt</li>
    <li>Civil Service</li>
    <li>Contractor</li></ul>
 <!-- this is redundant w/ next line: <p>The vast majority of City Jobs are Civil Service Jobs.</p>  -->
    
  <p><u>Regular jobs</u> (also called "civil service" or "non-exempt") are the majority of jobs in the City. And these can initially seem bureaucratic: An applicant takes a test specific to that job, gets a score, and interviews in very structured panel interviews. But if you get the job, there's tremendous job security. (For example, if you're "exempt" and you work for a councilmember, when he loses an election, you're probably out of a job. But that wouldn't be the case with a "regular" job.) </p>
  
  <p>Here's the list of current exams that are open for "regular" jobs at the <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/lacity">Government Jobs site</a>.</p>
  
  <p><u>Exempt Jobs</u> are listed at the <a href="http://per.lacity.org/index.cfm?content=exemptjobs">Personnel Department Site</a>. Applying for these positions is as simple as submiting a resume.</p>

  <p><u>Contractor Jobs</u> are for IT Contract Professionals within the City. (Think DevOps, Database Adminstrator, Data Scientist among a few examples). The Information Technology Agency maintains a contract with <a href="http://ita.lacity.org/about-ita/it-professional-contract-firms">7 Professional Contract Firms</a>. You have to contract them to apply for the jobs that are <i>typically</i> annual contract jobs. However, the process for getting hired as a contractor is much shorter than getting hired as regular/civil service employee.</p>
